The administration department of company XYZ aims to implement a year-round physical exercise program to help employees, particularly those who are overweight, lose weight based on their Body Mass Index (BMI). Before rolling out the program, they conducted a study to evaluate its effectiveness by collecting sample weight data from 30 employees. As a Data Science student, your task is to help the department determine whether the program is effective in reducing weight and to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight loss to understand the margin of error.
The ‘Dataset1’ details the weights of 30 samples recorded before and after participating in the program for the first 3 months.


Using Python jupyter notebooks, 
Determine if the program is effective for reducing weight.
Use inline comments in the code to explain every line and step of the code

Here is a sample of the excel dataset:
