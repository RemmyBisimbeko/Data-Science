For my assignment, Let me automate the process of scheduling and coordinating social events among friends or family members.

Problem Statement:

Organizing social events, such as Kwanjula, Kasiki, Weddings, dinner dates, movie nights, or game nights, often involves numerous back-and-forth messages, phone calls, and emails to find a suitable date and time that works for everyone. Coordinating attendees, deciding on activities, and keeping track of RSVPs can be time-consuming and challenging.

Solution: 

Social Event Scheduler and Coordinator

1. **Event Scheduling**:
   - I Developed a Python web application where users can create and schedule social events, specifying event details such as date, time, location, and activity.
   - Implement a calendar view that displays available time slots for each participant based on their availability preferences.
   - Allow users to invite friends or family members to the event and send automated notifications or reminders about the event details.
   - Integrate with popular calendar platforms like Google Calendar or Outlook to sync event schedules and avoid scheduling conflicts.
   - Provide options for users to suggest multiple date and time options for the event and vote on their preferred choice.

2. **RSVP Management**:
   - Enable attendees to RSVP to the event directly within the web app, indicating whether they will attend, decline, or are undecided.
   - Automatically update the event status based on RSVP responses and notify the event organizer of any changes in attendance.
   - Allow users to view the list of attendees, including their RSVP status and any comments or dietary restrictions they may have.

3. **Automated Reminders and Notifications**:
   - Send automated reminders to attendees leading up to the event, including details such as date, time, location, and any necessary preparations.
   - Notify users of any changes or updates to the event schedule, such as venue changes, time adjustments, or newly added activities.
   - Integrate with messaging platforms like SMS, email, or push notifications to ensure attendees stay informed and engaged throughout the planning process.

By automating event scheduling and coordination, users can streamline the process of planning social gatherings, reduce communication overhead, and ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for all participants. This solution fosters better communication, collaboration, and social engagement among friends and family members, making it easier to stay connected and create lasting memories together.
