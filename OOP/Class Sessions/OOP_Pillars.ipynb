Here's how the example showcases polymorphism:\n","\n","1. **Common Interface**: The `Animal` class defines a method `make_sound` without any implementation (abstract method). This method serves as a common interface that all subclasses are expected to implement.\n","\n","2. **Subclass Implementations**: Each subclass (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`) of the `Animal` class provides its own implementation of the `make_sound` method. This allows each type of animal to make a different sound when the `make_sound` method is called.\n","\n","3. **Interchangeable Usage**: Despite having different implementations of the `make_sound` method, instances of `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird` are stored in a list `animals` and iterated through in a loop. When calling the `make_sound` method on each animal, the appropriate sound is produced based on the type of animal, showcasing polymorphic behavior.\n","\n","4. **Dynamic Binding**: The decision of which `make_sound` method to execute is made dynamically at runtime based on the type of animal object being referred to. This dynamic method binding allows for flexibility and adaptability in the code.\n","\n","5. **Code Reusability**: By defining a common interface in the superclass and allowing subclasses to implement it in their own way, polymorphism promotes code reusability. It enables the same method (`make_sound` in this case) to be used across different types of animals without the need for separate implementations for each type.\n","\n","In summary, the example demonstrates polymorphism in Python by showing how objects of different classes (`Dog`, `Cat`, `Bird`) can be treated interchangeably as objects of a common superclass (`Animal`). Each subclass provides its own unique implementation of a shared method, allowing for flexibility, code reusability, and dynamic behavior based on the type of object being used."],"metadata":{"id":"LhJjE9XPZHwK"}}]}
